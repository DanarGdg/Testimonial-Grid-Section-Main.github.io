          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
          company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transitionand have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
           intro course and found it incredibly fun! i enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most gruelling-time of my life.
           Since completing the course.I've succesfully switched carrers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          students of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
          staff did not disappint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level
          in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've often reffered to it during inteciews as
          an example of my developent experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
          after receiveng multiple offers. 100% recommend!"

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselvs. Getting guidance from them and
          learning from their experiences was easy

          "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
